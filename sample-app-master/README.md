# League of Legends Time Tracker

This repository contains the app we worked on during MocoHacks:

- The app will launch automatically when a League game starts
- The app will remain in desktop mode until a League game starts where it will then switch to in-game overlay mode

## How to load the app

The app must be loaded as an unpackaged extension through overwolf's developer settings.
